Hello, you’re browsing the code for my professional website: [connorgraham.uk](https://connorgraham.uk)

## ~~CMS~~

The goal with this was to create a website that is dead simple for me to manage and that doesn’t require a CMS.

CMS solutions are great for large teams, but for a solo software engineer they can feel like extra steps that take more time than creating code.

## CSS

I’ve used the CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to save me time.

I’m always grateful for people that create these and make them freely available. I can produce complex SASS/CSS but it’s always nice not to have to, as they can be a lot of work when you include accessibility concerns.

Usually I work with Bootstrap, but I tried something different and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how much easier Bulma is to use.

## Hosting & Git

GitHub Pages hosts this site, and I have made the source code, including the full branch and tree structure, publicly available.

I use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for all of my projects and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), I have done on a semi-casual basis here as well.If you have any questions, please get in touch!
